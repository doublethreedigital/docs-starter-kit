This starter kit uses Laravel Mix to compile and process CSS & JavaScript assets. 

This means that every time you make changes to CSS or JS, you'll need to re-process your assets. Here's a little demo of how to do that.

> Oh and quick side note, you're gonna need to have your Npm or Yarn dependencies installed before running these commands. Just run `npm i`

## Processing for Development
If you're just wanting to compile the assets once, run `npm run dev`.

Or you can have it watching for changes, and compile when those changes happen. We also have BrowserSync setup so your page will refresh whenever a change happens, just like magic! âœ¨ `npm run watch`

## Processing for Production
When you run for production, Mix will also minify your styles and it will remove any style rules that aren't being used in your code. `npm run production`
