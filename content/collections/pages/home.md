This is a starter kit for [Statamic 3](https://statamic.dev) that gives you a start for creating your own beautiful documentation site.

Everything aside, this design was inspired (heavily) by [Tailwind's documentation](https://tailwindcss.com). Thanks Adam Wathan!

I'm not going to explain how everything works in this file or that would ruin it! Have a look around the docs so you can get a feel for how it looks.
